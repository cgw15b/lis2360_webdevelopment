    	<h1>How Do Analytics Effect Sports?</h1>
    	<img src="Images/sumo_paint_3.jpg" width="350" class="fltright"> 
    	<p>Recently, certain sports have gone under an analytics revolution. This website is designed to explain what analytics are and why teams are starting to utilize this tool.</p>
		<p>Sports analytics are a collection of relevant, historical, statistics that when properly applied can provide a competitive advantage to a team or individual. Analytics have a broad spectrum in that every sport has their own set of analytic statistics. From golf to baseball, analytics are everywhere. For instance, in baseball, batting average is the most common statistic where a player's batting average is determined by dividing their number of hits by the number of at bats they have. Because of a players batting average, a team can figure out the opposing player's tendencies and which pitches the batter struggles with. BA (Batting Average) is a simple statistic, however analytics can become increasingly more complex with on and off-field analytics. </p>
		<p>  In order to have a better understanding of the complexity of analytics we must first discuss the two key elements of analytics. The first key element is on-field analytics. On-field analytics are exactly what they sound like, they measure how a team is performing on the field as well as game tactics and player fitness. The second key element of analytics is Off-field analytics. Off-field analytics focus more on the business behind the sport team, such as merchandising, ticket sales, and even fan retention. The business analytics help owners increase profitability and make the correct financial decisions.</p>
		<p> Analytics can feel like a simple statistic, and sometimes they are, however, with the recent advancement in technology, new types of analytics have recently come to fruition that are revolutionizing the way sports are played and how players are scouted. For example, in the NBA, National Basketball Association, SportVU has revolutionized the game by using a camera tracking system that tracks player movement throughout the game. By tracking a player's movement, the data can explain how efficient a player is in each quarter of the game as well as how far they run, how much energy is expended, and where on the court a player is most comfortable. Not too long ago, people could never measure these important, specific statistics and coaches are taking advantage of the new technology to help create a championship team using advanced analytics. </p>
		<p>Nowadays, teams are constantly building their roster around player's strengths and using analytics to help find their strengths and weaknesses. However, this wasn't always the case. In the critically acclaimed film, Moneyball, Brad Pitt plays the Oakland A's 1998 general manager, Billy Beane, who is partially credited for the birth of major league analytics. Beane was faced with a tight budget and was at a disadvantage to the richer ball clubs when it came to signing star baseball players. Beane took advantage of sabermetrics and looked for players with strong on-base percentage. He filled his roster by using analytics and was able to sign cheap players that all worked well together due to their statistics.</p>
